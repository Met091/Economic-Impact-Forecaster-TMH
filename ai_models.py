def analyze_qualitative_event_llm(event_name: str, user_sentiment: str, currency: str, event_description: str = "") -> dict:
    """
    Simulates an LLM call to analyze a qualitative economic event.

    In a real implementation, this function would:
    1. Potentially fetch recent news/transcripts related to the event_name.
    2. Construct a detailed prompt for an LLM (e.g., Google's Gemini API).
       The prompt would include:
       - The event name and its general description.
       - The currency in focus.
       - The user-provided sentiment (Hawkish, Dovish, Neutral).
       - Any fetched news/context.
    3. The LLM would be asked to:
       - Elaborate on the potential market impact for the given currency.
       - Explain its reasoning based on the sentiment and event type.
       - Outline potential bullish and bearish arguments or key factors to watch.
       - Provide a confidence level or a summary of uncertainties.
    4. Parse the LLM's response into a structured dictionary.

    Args:
        event_name (str): The name of the qualitative event.
        user_sentiment (str): The user's perceived sentiment (e.g., "Hawkish", "Dovish", "Neutral").
        currency (str): The currency affected by the event.
        event_description (str): A general description of the event from INDICATOR_CONFIG.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the simulated LLM analysis.

                  "summary": "Detailed analysis...",
